# 🔧 Fix for Image Upload Persistence Issue

## Problem Identified
The issue was in the `TaskSubmission.getSubmissionsByUserAndDate()` method. It was using a date range query that might not have been matching the normalized dates correctly.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated TaskSubmission Model
**File:** `src/models/TaskSubmission.js`

**Old Method (using date range):**
```javascript
taskSubmissionSchema.statics.getSubmissionsByUserAndDate = function(userId, date) {
  const startOfDay = new Date(date);
  startOfDay.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  
  const endOfDay = new Date(date);
  endOfDay.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
  
  return this.find({
    user_id: userId,
    date: { $gte: startOfDay, $lte: endOfDay }
  }).populate('task_id');
};
```

**New Method (using exact date match):**
```javascript
taskSubmissionSchema.statics.getSubmissionsByUserAndDate = function(userId, date) {
  const { getStartOfDay } = require('../utils/dateUtils');
  const targetDate = getStartOfDay(date);
  
  return this.find({
    user_id: userId,
    date: targetDate
  }).populate('task_id');
};
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
- Added logging to progress controller
- Added logging to getTaskProgress service
- This will help identify any remaining issues

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Restart the Backend Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C) and restart
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Upload Flow
1. **Open frontend:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Navigate to a task** (e.g., "Morning Routine")
3. **Select a subtask** (e.g., "Skin Care")
4. **Upload an image** 
5. **Submit the subtask**
6. **Verify image appears immediately**
7. **Refresh the page (F5)**
8. **Verify image still appears** ✅

### Step 3: Check Backend Logs
With the debug logging added, you should see output like:
```
🔍 Progress request: { userId: 'test-user', date: '2025-06-29', targetDate: '2025-06-28T18:30:00.000Z' }
🔍 getTaskProgress called: { userId: 'test-user', date: '2025-06-29T09:25:10.021Z', targetDate: '2025-06-28T18:30:00.000Z' }
📋 Found X active tasks
📝 Found Y submissions for user test-user on 2025-06-28T18:30:00.000Z
📊 Progress result: X tasks found
   1. Morning Routine: 1/4 completed, 1 with images
```

### Step 4: Run Automated Test (Optional)
```bash
node test-upload-refresh-flow.js
```

This will test the complete flow programmatically.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Upload & Submit:** Image appears immediately  
✅ **Page Refresh:** Image persists and is still visible  
✅ **Backend Logs:** Show submissions being found correctly  
✅ **API Response:** Progress includes submission data with image URLs  

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was that the date range query (`$gte` and `$lte`) was not matching the exact normalized dates stored in the database. Since all submission dates are stored as start-of-day (e.g., `2025-06-28T18:30:00.000Z`), using an exact match is more reliable than a range query.

The fix ensures that:
1. When a subtask is submitted, it's stored with the correct normalized date
2. When progress is requested, it finds submissions using the same normalized date
3. The frontend receives the submission data including image URLs
4. Images persist correctly after page refresh

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backend server restarted with updated code
- [ ] Upload image to a subtask - image appears immediately
- [ ] Refresh page - image still appears
- [ ] Backend logs show submissions being found
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Image URLs are accessible and display correctly

If the issue persists after this fix, check the backend logs for the debug output to identify where the problem is occurring.
